# Machine-Learning-Syllabus-Practical

You will explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques, starting with the design of a basic ML model and progressing through algorithms like Find-S, Candidate Elimination, and Naive Bayes. You'll load and process data, perform feature selection, and use PCA for dimensionality reduction. Classification methods such as decision trees, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbors will be implemented, along with regression techniques like least squares. You'll also explore clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical), rule-based systems, and Bayesian networks for medical data. Additionally, text preprocessing and clustering will be covered, with evaluation metrics like confusion matrices used throughout for model performance assessment. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in implementing, testing, and evaluating a wide range of machine learning techniques.
