# Machine-Learning-Syllabus-Practical

You will explore a comprehensive set of machine learning algorithms and techniques, starting with the design of a simple ML model to train and test on real-world data. You will begin by implementing basic algorithms like the Find-S algorithm, which helps identify the most specific hypothesis from a set of training data, and the Candidate Elimination algorithm, which works by eliminating inconsistent hypotheses. Throughout this journey, you will also dive into probabilistic classifiers like Naive Bayes, which is essential for handling classification tasks in the presence of uncertainty. As part of the workflow, you will load and preprocess data from CSV files, applying feature selection techniques to determine the most relevant variables and use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining important patterns in the data.

Additionally, you will implement various classification algorithms, including decision trees and random forests, which will allow you to understand how tree-based models can handle both regression and classification tasks. Logistic regression, a widely used statistical model, will help you understand binary classification, while K-nearest neighbor (KNN) will allow you to see how instance-based learning operates. For regression, least squares regression will introduce you to predictive modeling for continuous variables. To deepen your knowledge of decision tree construction, you will implement the ID3 algorithm based on information gain, optimizing the model's decision-making ability.

Moving beyond classification and regression, clustering techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering will be explored to help you understand unsupervised learning and how data can be grouped without predefined labels. In parallel, you will implement and test rule-based systems that use predefined rules for decision-making, a method that is still widely used in expert systems. Furthermore, you will work with Bayesian networks, particularly in the context of medical data, to understand the probabilistic relationships between variables and how they can be used for diagnosis, such as predicting heart disease based on medical indicators.

The practical also includes exploring distance-based methods by implementing the Euclidean distance metric for KNN classification and performing text preprocessing, which involves preparing raw text data for machine learning by applying techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization. Text clustering and classification tasks will further enhance your understanding of handling textual data. Throughout these exercises, you will evaluate model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and other evaluation metrics, helping you grasp the importance of properly validating machine learning models. Overall, this practical provides a hands-on experience in building, testing, and refining a wide range of machine learning models and techniques, preparing you for more advanced applications in the field.
